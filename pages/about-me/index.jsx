      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p className="lead">
        Passionate about coding, I specialize in problem-solving through design
        and frontend development.
      </p>

      <p className="lead">
        Initially, I crafted responsive websites for Investor Relations clients.
        Later, I started to build custom CMS themes and evolved into a frontend
        developer and UX designer using Agile methods, AngularJS, ReactJS,
        Bootstrap, Sass, and third-party JavaScript libraries.
      </p>

      <p className="lead">
        Having experience collaborating with remote teams across different
        cities, I became proficient in using GIT for version control. With my
        expertise in building widgets, price tickers, and various website
        components, I could contribute significantly to designing and creating
        high-quality and detailed prototypes for app development, making
        possible to move quicker in the sprint board and increase the number of
        tasks. Committed to continuous learning, I prioritize collaboration and
        customer satisfaction in my work.
